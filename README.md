<h1> UTOOB </h1>

<h2> Motivation </h2>
<p> After about the fiftieth entire day that I wasted watching YouTube shorts, I dreamt up this little project.
UTOOB is designed to be a healthier user experience for watching YouTube videos. The user specifies a list of 
channels and is only presented with those channels. As such it should force the user (me) to be more intentional
about the way that they spend their time watching videos. </p>

<h2> Installation </h2>
<p> At the time of uploading, the project is not yet ready for distribution. </p>

<h2> Contact and Future Improvements </h2>
<ul> Please see the issues list to see what functionality I intend to add. </ul>
<ul> I welcome suggestions and contributions! Please email ryty.boyce@gmail.com with any questions. </ul>
